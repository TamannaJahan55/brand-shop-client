## Add at least five bullet points about your project.

#### I have created a Cosmetics and Beauty category based Brand Website named "Evergreen". 5 points about my project are given below:

- **User-Friendly Navigation:** The Evergreen cosmetics and beauty website features a well-structured navbar that offers easy access to various sections. It includes the company's logo and website name ("Evergreen") along with five primary routes: Home, Add Product, My Cart, Login, and Register. The navbar also dynamically adjusts, displaying a user's name, photo, and a "Sign Out" button if they are logged in, or showing a "Login" button if they are not logged in.

- **Banner Section:** The homepage prominently displays a banner section that showcases appealing banner images and the website's name, "Evergreen," along with a captivating title. This section serves as an eye-catching introduction to the website's offerings.

- **Our Brands:** Evergreen's "Our Brands" section introduces users to six distinct brands, each featuring the brand's name - LOreal, Est√©e Lauder, Chanel, Urban Decay and Avon, and a corresponding brand image. Users can click on any brand card to access brand-related products and a brand-specific advertisement slider in the "Branded Products" route, which is a private route.

- **User Cart and Product Management:** The website allows users to add products to their cart, which is associated with their email for easy identification. Users can also delete products from their cart. Additionally, there is a provision for administrators to add new products via an "Add Product" form and update existing product information via update product form through a private "Update Product" route. This functionality is essential for maintaining an up-to-date product catalog.

- **User Registration and Authentication:** The website includes a user registration page, ensuring that new users can easily sign up to access the website's features. It also provides a secure login process, where users are redirected to the login route when trying to access private sections. Once logged in, they gain access to these private pages and enjoy a personalized experience.

Overall, Evergreen's website not only offers a visually appealing and user-friendly interface but also incorporates essential functionality for both users and administrators to manage and explore cosmetic and beauty products effectively.
